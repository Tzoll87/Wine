A short prediction modell for the Wine dataset - also can be found at kaggle. The dataset contains 6497 rows and 13 columns, of which 12 columns, with missing values can be used as independent variables, and the quality column as a dependent variable. After fixing the problems of missing values, and standardizing the values, a prediction modell is built to predict the quality of a given wine.
